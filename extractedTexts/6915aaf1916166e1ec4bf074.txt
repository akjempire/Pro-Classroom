Cloud computing has transformed the way organizations store, manage, and access data. Instead
of relying solely on physical hardware, cloud platforms allow scalable and flexible computing
through remote servers. This reduces operational costs, enhances security, and increases
accessibility. Cloud services generally fall under three major categories: Infrastructure as a Service,
Platform as a Service, and Software as a Service. Organizations can choose services based on
their needs, making cloud computing a versatile solution. With proper implementation, cloud
technology helps improve efficiency, collaboration, and disaster recovery. These benefits have
fueled the rapid global adoption of cloud solutions.
