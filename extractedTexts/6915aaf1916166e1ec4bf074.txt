Machine learning is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on building systems capable of
learning from data. These systems identify structures, make outcomes, and improve their
performance over time without being explicitly programmed. The process typically involves feeding
data into algorithms, which then adjust internal parameters to minimize errors in outcomes.
Machine learning has applications in recommendation systems, fraud detection, natural language
processing, and healthcare. As datasets grow larger, machine learning models continue to improve.
Supervised learning relies on labeled data, while unsupervised learning discovers hidden structures
in unlabeled data. Reinforcement learning enables systems to learn through trial and error by
receiving rewards or penalties. Advancements in computing power and data availability have
allowed machine learning to evolve rapidly, making it one of the most influential technologies in the
modern world. The growing demand for automation, accuracy, and personalization is driving
organizations to adopt machine learning solutions. Researchers continue to innovate new methods
to increase efficiency, interpretability, and scalability across various industries.
