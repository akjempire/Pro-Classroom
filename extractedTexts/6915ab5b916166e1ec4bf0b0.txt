Artificial intelligence plays a critical role in shaping modern technology. It enables machines to
perform cognitive tasks such as learning, reasoning, and decision-making. AI systems analyze
large amounts of data to recognize patterns and generate predictions. This technology powers
virtual assistants, self-driving cars, and recommendation systems. AI relies heavily on data,
algorithms, and computational power. As research progresses, AI continues to improve automation,
accuracy, and personalization in various industries. While AI offers many benefits, it also raises
ethical concerns such as privacy, bias, and accountability.
